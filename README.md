webdevblog-example
==================

The example webdevblog for the server-side programming session for ScottyLabs' WebDevWeeks.

This repo is NOT for students in the WebDevWeeks session - there is a separate repo for that, and we'll probably have a zip file for you to download in a separate location.

This repo, in addition to the filled out files for WebDevWeeks, includes files for Heroku, like the Procfile.
